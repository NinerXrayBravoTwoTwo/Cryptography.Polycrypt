Cryptography.Polycrypt
======================
Core module that creates classic Poly alphabet ciphers.  

In this modern day of 'unbreakable' military grade comercial ciphers, AES, DES, Twofish, Blowfish, RSA, SSL, and Bruce Schneier this project tries to make sending secret code fun again by removing, potentially the need for a computer.   A person can write these poly alphabet ciphers on a piece of paper, put a pencil in their pocket and leave secret messages without ever touching a keyboard where ever they may roam.
