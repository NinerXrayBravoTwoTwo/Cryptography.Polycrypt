Cryptography.Polycrypt
======================
Core module that creates classic Poly alphabet ciphers.  

In this modern day of 'unbreakable' military grade comercial ciphers, AES, DES, Twofish, Blowfish, RSA, SSL, and Bruce Schneier this project tries to make sending secret code fun again by removing, potentially the need for a computer.   A person can write these poly alphabet ciphers on a piece of paper, put a pencil in their pocket and leave secret messages without ever touching a keyboard where ever they may roam.

Ye Olde Fashion Cipher
======================
The classic [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) is the kind of thing where your parents, as kids, would have gotten an 'encoder' ring out of a crackerjack box. These codes are not secure relative to modern industry grade encryption.

This library and associated software can generate polyalphabetic key sets and encrypt dectypt messages.  With just the key a person can 
encode and decode messages with a pencil and paper never actually needing a computer.

Support is in the code for;
* Vigenere multiple alphabet
* Multiple random alphabets
* Auto Key is not implemented yet in this code
